title: "Dependencies on Data and Code"
teaching: 15
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How can I write a Makefile to update things when my scripts have changed rather than my input files?"
objectives:
- "Output files are a product not only of input files but of the scripts or code that created the output files."
- "Recognize and avoid false dependencies."
keypoints:
- "Make results depend on processing scripts as well as data files."
- "Dependencies are transitive: if A depends on B and B depends on C, a change to C will indirectly trigger an update to A."
---

Our Makefile now looks like this:

~~~
# Generate summary table.
results.txt : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
	python testzipf.py $^ > $@

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
	python countwords.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
	python countwords.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt
	python countwords.py $< $@

.PHONY : clean
clean :
	rm -f *.dat
	rm -f results.txt
~~~
{: .language-make}

Our data files are a product not only of our text files but the
script, `countwords.py`, that processes the text files and creates the
data files. A change to `countwords.py` (e.g. to add a new column of
summary data or remove an existing one) results in changes to the
`.dat` files it outputs. So, let's pretend to edit `countwords.py`,
using `touch`, and re-run Make:

~~~
$ make dats
$ touch countwords.py
$ make dats
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Nothing happens! Though we've updated `countwords.py` our data files
are not updated because our rules for creating `.dat` files don't
record any dependencies on `countwords.py`.

We need to add `countwords.py` as a dependency of each of our
data files also:

~~~
isles.dat : books/isles.txt countwords.py
	python countwords.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt countwords.py
	python countwords.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt countwords.py
	python countwords.py $< $@
~~~
{: .language-make}

If we pretend to edit `countwords.py` and re-run Make,

~~~
$ touch countwords.py
$ make dats
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

~~~
python countwords.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python countwords.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python countwords.py books/last.txt last.dat
~~~
{: .output}

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our
Makefile, involved in building the `results.txt` target, after adding
`countwords.py` and `testzipf.py` as dependencies to their respective target
files (i.e. how the Makefile should look after completing the rest of the
exercises in this episode).

Intuitively, we should also add `countwords.py` as dependency for
`results.txt`, as the final table should be rebuilt as we remake the
`.dat` files. However, it turns out we don't have to! Let's see what
happens to `results.txt` when we update `countwords.py`:

~~~
$ touch countwords.py
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

then we get:

~~~
python countwords.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python countwords.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python countwords.py books/last.txt last.dat
python testzipf.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt
~~~
{: .output}

The whole pipeline is triggered, even the creation of the
`results.txt` file! To understand this, note that according to the
dependency figure, `results.txt` depends on the `.dat` files. The
update of `countwords.py` triggers an update of the `*.dat`
files. Thus, `make` sees that the dependencies (the `.dat` files) are
newer than the target file (`results.txt`) and thus it recreates
`results.txt`. This is an example of the power of `make`: updating a
subset of the files in the pipeline triggers rerunning the appropriate
downstream steps.

We still have to add the `testzipf.py` script as dependency to
`results.txt`. Given the answer to the challenge above, we cannot use
`$^` in the rule.  
We can however move `testzipf.py` to be the
first dependency and then use `$<` to refer to it. 
In order to refer to the `.dat` files, we can just use `*.dat` for now (we will
cover a better solution later on).

~~~
results.txt : testzipf.py isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
	python $< *.dat > $@
