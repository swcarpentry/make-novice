title: "Dependencies on Data and Code"
teaching: 15
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I write a Makefile to update things when my scripts have changed rather than my input files?"
objectives:
- "Output files are a product not only of input files but of the scripts or code that created the output files."
- "Recognize and avoid false dependencies."
keypoints:
- "Make results depend on processing scripts as well as data files."
- "Dependencies are transitive: if A depends on B and B depends on C, a change to C will indirectly trigger an update to A."

Our Makefile now looks like this:

~~~
# Generate summary table.
results.txt : *.dat
        python zipf_test.py $^ > $@

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
        python wordcount.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
        python wordcount.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt
        python wordcount.py $< $@

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f results.txt
~~~
{: .make}

Our data files are a product not only of our text files but the
script, `wordcount.py`, that processes the text files and creates the
data files. A change to `wordcount.py` (e.g. to add a new column of
summary data or remove an existing one) results in changes to the
`.dat` files it outputs. So, let's pretend to edit `wordcount.py`,
using `touch`, and re-run Make:

~~~
$ make dats
$ touch wordcount.py
$ make dats
~~~
{: .bash}

Nothing happens! Though we've updated `wordcount.py` our data files
are not updated because our rules for creating `.dat` files don't
record any dependencies on `wordcount.py`.

We need to add `wordcount.py` as a dependency of each of our
data files also:

~~~
isles.dat : books/isles.txt wordcount.py
        python wordcount.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt wordcount.py
        python wordcount.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt wordcount.py
        python wordcount.py $< $@
~~~
{: .make}

If we pretend to edit `wordcount.py` and re-run Make,

~~~
$ touch wordcount.py
$ make dats
~~~
{: .bash}

then we get:

~~~
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
~~~
{: .output}

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our
Makefile, involved in building the `results.txt` target, after adding
`wordcount.py` as a dependency to the `.dat` files:

![results.txt dependencies after adding wordcount.py as a dependency](../fig/04-dependencies.png "results.txt dependencies after adding wordcount.py as a dependency")

{: .callout}

Intuitively, we should also add `wordcount.py` as dependency for
`results.txt`, as the final table should be rebuilt as we remake the
`.dat` files. However, it turns out we don't have to! Let's see what
happens to `results.txt` when we update `wordcount.py`:

~~~
$ touch wordcount.py
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

then we get:

~~~
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt
~~~
{: .output}

The whole pipeline is triggered, even the creation of the
`results.txt` file! To understand this, note that according to the
dependency figure, `results.txt` depends on the `.dat` files. The
update of `wordcount.py` triggers an update of the `*.dat`
files. Thus, `make` sees that the dependencies (the `.dat` files) are
newer than the target file (`results.txt`) and thus it recreates
`results.txt`. This is an example of the power of `make`: updating a
subset of the files in the pipeline triggers rerunning the appropriate
downstream steps.

We still have to add the `zipf-test.py` script as dependency to
`results.txt`. Given the answer to the challenge above, we cannot use
`$^` for the rule. We'll go back to using `*.dat`:

~~~
results.txt : *.dat zipf_test.py
        python zipf_test.py *.dat > $@
~~~
{: .make}
