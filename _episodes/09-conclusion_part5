> ## Archiving the Makefile
>
> Why do we add the Makefile to our archive of code, data, plots and Zipf summary table?
>
> > ## Solution
> > Our code (`wordcount.py`, `plotcount.py`, `zipf_test.py`) implement
> > the individual parts of our workflow. They allow us to create `.dat`
> > files from `.txt` files, `.png` files from `.dat` files and
> > `results.txt`. Our Makefile, however, documents dependencies between
> > our code, raw data, derived data, and plots, as well as implementing
> > our workflow as a whole.
