After the exercise at the end of the previous part, our Makefile look like this:

~~~
# Generate summary table.
results.txt : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
        python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
        python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat

last.dat : books/last.txt
        python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f results.txt
~~~
{: .make}

Our Makefile has a lot of duplication. For example, the names of text
files and data files are repeated in many places throughout the
Makefile. Makefiles are a form of code and, in any code, repeated code
can lead to problems e.g. we rename a data file in one part of the
Makefile but forget to rename it elsewhere.

{: .callout}

Let us set about removing some of the repetition from our Makefile.

In our `results.txt` rule we duplicate the data file names and the
name of the results file name:

~~~
results.txt : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > results.txt
~~~
{: .make}

Looking at the results file name first, we can replace it in the action
with `$@`:

~~~
results.txt : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        python zipf_test.py abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat > $@
~~~
{: .make}

`$@` is a Make [automatic variable]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#automatic-variable)
which means 'the target of the current rule'. When Make is run it will
replace this variable with the target name.

We can replace the dependencies in the action with `$^`:

~~~
results.txt : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        python zipf_test.py $^ > $@
~~~
{: .make}

`$^` is another automatic variable which means 'all the dependencies
of the current rule'. Again, when Make is run it will replace this
variable with the dependencies.

Let's update our text files and re-run our rule:

~~~
$ touch books/*.txt
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

We get:

~~~
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
python zipf_test.py isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat > results.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We can use the bash wildcard in our dependency list:

~~~
results.txt : *.dat
        python zipf_test.py $^ > $@
~~~
{: .make}

Let's update our text files and re-run our rule:

~~~
$ touch books/*.txt
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

We get the same as above.

Now let's delete the data files and re-run our rule:

~~~
$ make clean
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

We get:

~~~
make: *** No rule to make target `*.dat', needed by `results.txt'.  Stop.
~~~
{: .error}

As there are no files that match the pattern `*.dat` the name `*.dat`
is used as a file name itself, and there is no file matching that, nor
any rule so we get an error. We need to explicitly rebuild the `.dat`
files first:

~~~
$ make dats
$ make results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .challenge}

As we saw, `$^` means 'all the dependencies of the current rule'. This
works well for `results.txt` as its action treats all the dependencies
the same - as the input for the `zipf_test.py` script.

However, for some rules, we may want to treat the first dependency
differently. For example, our rules for `.dat` use their first (and
only) dependency specifically as the input file to `wordcount.py`. If
we add additional dependencies (as we will soon do) then we don't want
these being passed as input files to `wordcount.py` as it expects only
one input file to be named when it is invoked.

Make provides an automatic variable for this, `$<` which means 'the
first dependency of the current rule'.
