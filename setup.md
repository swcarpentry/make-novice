## Software

You also need to have the following software installed on your computer to
follow this lesson:

### GNU Make

#### Linux

Make is a standard tool on most Linux systems and should already be available.
Check if you already have Make installed by typing `make -v` into a terminal.

One exception is Debian, and you should install Make from the terminal using
`sudo apt-get install make`.

#### OSX

You will need to have Xcode installed (download from the
[Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)).
Check if you already have Make installed by typing `make -v` into a terminal.

#### Windows
Use the Software Carpentry
[Windows installer](https://github.com/swcarpentry/windows-installer).

### Python

Python2 or Python3, Numpy and Matplotlib are required.
They can be installed separately, but the easiest approach is to install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which includes all of the
necessary python software.
