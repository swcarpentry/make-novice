            Thank you for your contribution. This lesson has migrated to use
            [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench) 
            and the `gh-pages` branch is now automatically generated. This
            means in order to contribute, **you will need to delete and re-fork
            this repository.**

            ## How to contribute
            
            If you wish to contribute, you will need to use the following steps
            to delete, re-fork, and re-create your pull request (aka the [burn
            it all down strategy](https://happygitwithr.com/burn.html)):

            1. Save your edits on locally or in a scratch space.

            2. **[Delete your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)** 

            3. **[Create a new fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)** or use the "edit" button on the page you wish to edit.

            4. Apply your changes (**NOTE The Workbench uses a different syntax.** Here is a [Transition Guide from Styles to Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html) for your reference).
