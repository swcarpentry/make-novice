## Parallel Execution

Make can build dependencies in _parallel_ sub-processes, via its `--jobs`
flag (or its `-j` abbreviation) which specifies the number of sub-processes to use e.g.

~~~
$ make --jobs 4 results.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

If we have independent dependencies then these can be built at the
same time. For example, `abyss.dat` and `isles.dat` are mutually
independent and can both be built at the same time. Likewise for
`abyss.png` and `isles.png`. If you've got a bunch of independent
branches in your analysis, this can greatly speed up your build
process.

For more information see the GNU Make manual chapter on [Parallel
Execution][gnu-make-parallel].

## Different Types of Assignment

Some Makefiles may contain `:=` instead of `=`. Your Makefile may
behave differently depending upon which you use and how you use it:

* A variable defined using `=` is a _recursively expanded
  variable_. Its value is calculated only when its value is
  requested. If the value assigned to the variable itself contains
  variables (e.g. `A = $(B)`) then these variables' values are only
  calculated when the variable's value is requested (e.g. the value of
  `B` is only calculated when the value of `A` is requested via
  `$(A)`. This can be termed _lazy setting_.

* A variable defined using `:=` is a _simply expanded variable_. Its
  value is calculated when it is declared. If the value assigned to
  the variable contains variables (e.g. `A = $(B)`) then these
  variables' values are also calculated when the variable is declared
  (e.g. the value of `B` is calculated when `A` is assigned
  above). This can be termed _immediate setting_.

For a detailed explanation, see:

* GNU Make [The Two Flavors of Variables][gnu-make-variables]

## Make and Version Control

Like any other scripts, 
Makefiles can be managed using a version control system like Git or Mercurial.
For this management,
it is desirable to track all changes except those that alter the configuration only.
For instance, 
let's say we'd like to run the workflow developed in this lesson for three different word counting scripts,
in order to compare their speed (e.g. `wordcount.py`, `wordcount2.py`, `wordcount3.py`).
To do this, 
we could edit `config.mk` directly by replacing `COUNT_SRC=wordcount.py` with `COUNT_SRC=wordcount2.py`,
but this would be detected as a change by the version control system.
An alternative approach is to leave `config.mk` untouched by overwriting the value of `COUNT_SRC` 
at the command line instead:

~~~
$ make variable COUNT_SRC=wordcount2.py
~~~
{: .bash}

The configuration file then simply contains the default values for the workflow, 
and by overwriting the defaults at the command line you can avoid cluttering your 
version control history with configuration changes.
